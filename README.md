# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to improve the reservations page by implementing a calendar that shows availability. Any reservation time-slots that are already booked would be marked as unavailable or shaded while any available spaces would be shown in green.
